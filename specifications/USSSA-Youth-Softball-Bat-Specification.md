# USSSA-Youth-Softball-Bat-Specification.md

## 1. Executive Summary  
This document defines the complete technical specification for a next-generation USSSA-compliant youth softball bat intended for an 11-year-old beginner (approx. 68 in / 173 cm tall). The bat’s primary goals are:  
* Enable consistent contact through an expanded sweet spot  
* Minimise swing fatigue with an ultra-light balanced profile  
* Provide a confidence-boosting floral-scented grip designed for girls

## 6. Manufacturing Requirements  
1. **Extrusion & Draw:** Barrel tube extruded then draw-formed to ±0.005 in tolerance.  
2. **CNC Taper Machining:** Five-axis milling of transition zone; roughness ≤ Ra 0.4 µm.  
3. **Composite Sleeving:** Insert carbon sleeve with epoxy cure cycle 120 °C × 45 min.  
4. **Heat Treatment:** 7055-T6 ageing per AMS-2772.  
5. **Anodising & Paint:** Type II sulphuric anodise, thickness 0.0006 in; two-stage polyurethane paint.  
6. **Grip Over-mould:** Injection at 190 °C, pressure 850 bar; integrate scent beads last 5 s of cycle.  
7. **Quality Stamp & Serialisation:** Laser-etch USSSA mark and unique 12-digit SN.  

---

## 7. Quality Control Standards  
* **Dimensional Audit:** Sample 10 % of lot; digital calliper & laser scan.  
* **Drop Test:** 3× 6 ft knob-down + cap-down; no structural failure.  
* **Compression Test:** USSSA certification ≤ 1550 lbf.  
* **Vibration Test:** Peak G ≤ 40 at handle upon barrel impact.  
* **Odour Longevity:** ≥ 90 % scent intensity after 5 k swings (accelerated).  
* **Cosmetic Inspection:** No paint runs, grip delamination, or sharp edges.  

---

## 8. Safety Considerations  
* Rounded edges on knob and cap to prevent cuts.  
* Non-toxic scent oils; compliance with EN 71-3 & ASTM F963 heavy-metal limits.  
* Grip material REACH & CPSIA certified.  
* Warning label: “Protective equipment recommended; inspect bat before each use.”
