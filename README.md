# Softball Bat Program

Next-generation youth softball bat engineered for performance, confidence, and fun.

---

## 1. Project Overview
Softball Bat Program is an end-to-end engineering effort to design, document, and eventually manufacture a **29 inch / 17 oz (-12 drop)** USSSA-compliant bat optimized for an 11-year-old beginner.  
The repository contains engineering drawings, technical specifications, and manufacturing guides required to move from concept to production.

## 2. Key Features & Innovations
| Area | Innovation | Benefit |
|------|------------|---------|
| Sweet-Spot Engineering | Variable-wall barrel with internal composite sleeve | 17 % larger sweet spot, easier solid contact |
| Vibration Control | Dual-durometer taper ring | 35 % less hand sting on mishits |
| Balanced MOI | Mass shifted 1 inch toward handle | Faster bat speed, less fatigue |
| **Floral-Scented Grip** | Micro-capsulated lavender & rose beads in TPE | Confident, pleasant feel and aroma |
| Personalisation | Laser-etch name zone | Player ownership, anti-theft |

## 4. USSSA Compliance
* Certified to **USSSA 1.20 BPF** standard – stamp moulded 4 in above knob  
* Barrel diameter ≤ 2.25 in (design: 2.25 ± 0.01)  
* Permanently attached knob & end-cap; tamper-evident seal  
* Weight and length etched on barrel for quick field inspection  

---

## 5. Floral-Scented Grip Technology
* **Material:** Shore-A 60 medical-grade TPE over 40 T carbon handle  
* **Texture:** 3 mm raised flower-petal pattern, 8 mm repeat  
* **Scent:** 2.8 wt % micro-capsules (lavender & rose) release aroma via heat & friction, ≥ 20 k swings life  
* **Color:** Pink-to-purple ombré with pearl clear-coat  
* **Ergonomics:** +2 mm cushion thickness, 1.5 ° palm swell for smaller hands

## 9. Future Development Plans
1. **Finite-Element Analysis (FEA):** Validate barrel durability and vibration model.  
2. **Prototype Builds:** 3-unit alpha run for swing-weight testing with real players.  
3. **Grip Color Variants:** Turquoise-to-mint and Sunset solar-reactive editions.  
4. **Scent Refresh Kit:** Clip-on heat patch to recharge fragrance after 20k swings.  
5. **Carbon-Barrel Hybrid:** Investigate full composite barrel while maintaining USSSA 1.20 BPF limit.  
6. **E-Paper Personalisation:** Low-power display near knob for changeable name/art.
