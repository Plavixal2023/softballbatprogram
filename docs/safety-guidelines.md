## 5  Age-Appropriate Usage
| Age | Recommended Length | Drop | Notes |
|-----|--------------------|------|-------|
| 9–10 | 28 in | –12 to –13 | Consider lighter 26 oz swing weight |

| 13+ | 30–32 in | –11 to –10 | Transition to heavier bats as strength grows |

Players outside weight/strength norms should be fitted by a coach before use.

## 6  Adult Supervision
* A certified coach or responsible adult must be present during all practice and game activities.  
* Adults should control batting order and retrieve stray bats quickly.  
* Store bat in a secured equipment bag when not actively used to prevent unsupervised play.

## 7  Storage & Care
1. **Temperature:** Keep between 45 °F–95 °F (7 °C–35 °C). Extreme cold can cause micro-fractures; high heat can degrade scent capsules.  
2. **Moisture:** Dry bat before storage; prolonged dampness may corrode alloy interface.  
3. **Transport:** Use padded bat sleeve; avoid rolling loose in vehicle trunk.  
4. **Cleaning:** Wipe with mild soap and water; avoid solvents that may strip paint or scent layer.  
5. **Off-Season:** Store horizontally on two supports or vertically grip-down; never rest barrel on concrete for extended periods.

## 8  Allergy & Sensitivity Warnings
* Grip contains micro-encapsulated **lavender and rose essential oils** (≤0.15 mL per grip).  
* Individuals with known **flower or fragrance allergies** should test by lightly holding grip for 5 minutes before play.  
* Discontinue use if rash, itching, or respiratory irritation occurs; wash hands and consult medical professional.  
* Grip material is medical-grade TPE, free of latex and phthalates.
